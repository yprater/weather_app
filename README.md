# Yuri's Weather Forecast App

## Overview

Welcome to Yuri's Weather Forecast App! My name is Yuri and I'm a QA professional searching for his next role after being laid off by my previous employer on August 1st, 2023. This app was created to showcase my experience writing API test and using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This simple web application allows users to get current weather information for a specific city. It's a great way to check your weather coniditons before planning your day.

## How it Works

1. **Enter City:** Type the name of a city in the input field provided (e.g., "Seattle").

2. **Click Button:** Click the button next to the field to fetch current weather data entered for the city.

3. **Weather Display:** The weather information, including the city name, temperature in Celsius, and weather description, will be displayed below the input field.

## Running the App Locally

To run the app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/yprater/weather_app.git

2. **Open the App:** Navigate to the repository directory on your local machine and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. **Get Your API Key:** You'll need an API key to fetch weather data. Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to sign up and obtain a free API key.

4. **Configure API Key:** In the `script.js` file, replace `config.apiKey` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

5. **Run the App:** Once you've added your API key, refresh the webpage in your browser. You can now use the app to check the weather for different cities.

## Note

Please keep in mind that this app uses data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Be mindful of API usage limits and respect their terms of use.
